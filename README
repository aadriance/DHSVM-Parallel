#DHSVM-Parallel

This GitHub repo is based off of DHSVM3.1.2, whose original repo is at https://github.com/pnnl/DHSVM-PNNL.  This repo is the result of my thesis work that was defended on May 23, 2018.

As of May 24th, this repo is mostly a dump of my thesis code with some minor clean up.  In June and July I plan to clean up my changes and document them with comments in code to make it better for people in the future.

Once my thesis is finalized I will add a link to it here.

#Basic Usage

Currently, if you somply follow the origina tutorial PDF in the repo, and compile DHSVM using the makefile_for_binary option, you will end up with a parallel version of DHSVM that uses 4 threads, and in my experience runs about 4 times faster.

#Added features

I added the ability to specify random ranges in the input file for DHSVM.  For example, in the example input file that comes with this repo:

Ground Roughness     = 0.02 

If you'd like to change to to have DHSVM pick a random value between 0.02-0.05, simpl use:

Ground Roughness     = <0.02-0.05>

#Compiler Options

I tried to make  makefile_for_binary easy to work with for configuring how you'd like to use DHSVM.  There are several option and definitions of interest:

##openMPI

openMPI is used in this rendition of DHSVM to run more than one copy at a time.  To enable MPI changes add the _USE_MPI def to the DEFS list, and change CC to mpicc.  Once MPI is enabled DHSVM requires a new command line input parameter for how many DHSVM instances you'd like.  for example:

./DHSVM3.1.2 INPUT_FILE NUM_OF_RUNS

##openMP

By default the program noe compiles with openMP.  If you do not want openMP, simply comment out the "MP = ..." line.  This will #ifdef's to remove all openMP code from the program.

##TCMalloc

My thesis used TCMalloc to signifigantly speed up runtimes.  By defualt I have this enabled in the make file, but requires that you locally install the TCMalloc library.  gperftools, which contains TCMalloc, is at  https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools.

If you do not wish to use TCMalloc simply comment out the "TCMALLOC = ..." line in makefile_for_binary.
